The goal of `geomorphcompanion` is to supplement the `geomorph` package. Really, it's **wonderful**. Me and my group have just run into a few problems.

## Installation

You can install the development version of geomorphcompanion with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ckenaley/geomorphcompanion")
```
